# Computational Physics Code Physics 246 
Coding different physics simulations and models
1) Calculating Pi -- Different ways to estimate the values of pi using geometry and monte carlo simulations
2) Dynamics -- Different integrators developed to estimate simple Newtonian Mechanics
3) Orbits -- Using dynamics integrators and step functions with real objects to create simple galaxies
4) Predator Prey -- Solving differential equations that represent Lotkaâ€“Volterra predator prey models and creates insightful animations of an agent based model too
5) Random Walks -- Modeling the dust in the air or pollen in water with custom random walk functions
6) Galaxy -- Galaxy identification with a simple ML model (still in progress)
